### Looping through javascript exercises while attempting to learn the language.


Repo of my solutions to the [elequent js book](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) (2nd edition).


For my own peace of mind, I'm adding this to remind me of the git workflow:
```
git add *
git commit -m "message"
git push
```
